# Dashboard Enhancement Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the WeSeedU dashboard with two new features:
1. Community Integration
2. Goal Tracking & Milestones

These enhancements aim to create a more comprehensive and engaging dashboard that helps users track their sustainable investment journey and connect with like-minded investors.

## 1. Community Integration Feature

### Goals & Purpose
- Increase user engagement with community content
- Provide visibility into community activities directly from the dashboard
- Encourage participation in sustainability-focused discussions
- Create a sense of belonging among users with similar investment interests

### Implementation Requirements

#### Database Changes
- Utilize the existing database structure:
  - `community_posts`
  - `company_communities`
  - `community_members` 
  - `profiles`
- Create a view (`user_community_activity`) for efficient community content querying
- Create functions for retrieving user community stats

#### API Routes
- `/api/dashboard/community-feed` - Get personalized community activity and stats

#### Frontend Components
- `CommunityIntegration.tsx` - Main component for the dashboard
  - Activity feed showing recent posts from joined communities
  - Community statistics display (communities joined, posts created, comments made)
  - Navigation to full community features

### Success Criteria
- Users can view community activity without leaving the dashboard
- Community participation metrics are visible and up-to-date
- Content is personalized based on the user's community memberships
- Performance impact on dashboard load time is minimal (<500ms additional)

## 2. Goal Tracking & Milestones Feature

### Goals & Purpose
- Enable users to set and track sustainability investment goals
- Provide visual indicators of progress toward financial and impact goals
- Recognize achievements with milestone celebrations
- Increase user motivation through goal visualization
- Create a gamified experience for sustainable investing

### Implementation Requirements

#### Database Changes
- Create new tables:
  - `user_goals` - Store user-defined sustainability investment goals
  - `user_milestones` - Track achievements and completed goals
- Implement security policies for data protection
- Create an automated function and trigger to update goals when investments are made

#### API Routes
- `/api/dashboard/goals` - CRUD operations for user goals
- `/api/dashboard/goals/[id]` - Update specific goal progress

#### Frontend Components
- `GoalTracker.tsx` - Main component for the dashboard
  - Goal creation and management interface
  - Progress visualization with progress bars and statistics
  - Milestone achievements display
  - Category-based filtering (environmental, social, governance)

### Success Criteria
- Users can create, edit, and track sustainability goals
- Progress updates automatically when new investments are made
- Goals are categorized by ESG criteria (environmental, social, governance)
- Milestones are automatically generated when goals are completed
- All data is protected by proper security policies

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Execute SQL queries to create necessary database objects
2. Verify row-level security is properly implemented
3. Test functions with sample data

### Phase 2: API Development
1. Create API routes for both features
2. Implement authentication checks using the existing `authCheck.ts` utility
3. Create appropriate error handling and response formatting
4. Document API endpoints

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
1. Develop reusable components for both features
2. Integrate with the existing dashboard layout
3. Implement proper caching for performance optimization
4. Ensure responsive design across device sizes

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
1. Test features across different environments (dev, test, prod)
2. Gather feedback from internal stakeholders
3. Implement any necessary adjustments
4. Deploy to production

## Best Practices to Follow

- Maintain code under 300 lines per file
- Follow existing styling patterns
- Use caching for improved performance
- Avoid duplication by reusing existing components where possible
- Write clean, maintainable code with proper error handling
- Ensure each component handles loading, error, and empty states appropriately
- Optimize for performance, especially for data fetching operations

# Coding Pattern preferences 

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible by checking for similar functionality elsewhere in the codebase.
- Write code that takes into account different environments: dev, test, and prod.
-Only make changes that are requested or that you fully understand and are directly related to the requested change.
When fixing an issue or bug, exhaust all options within the existing implementation before introducing a new pattern or technology. If you do switch approaches, remove the old implementation to avoid duplicate knowledge.
Keep the codebase clean and organized.
Avoid writing scripts in files, especially if the script is likely to run only once.
Keep files under 200-300 lines of code; refactor if they exceed that limit.
Only mock data for testsâ€”never for dev or prod.
Never add stubbing or fake data patterns in code that affects the dev or prod environment.
Never overwrite any .env file without first asking for confirmation.
